This script creates a simple Tkinter-based GUI with entry fields, buttons, and a listbox. Users can enter a YouTube video URL,
click a button to display available streams, choose a download location, and download the selected video stream. 
The GUI provides a more user-friendly experience and should work on both PCs and phones with Python installed.

Note: For running on a phone, you would typically need to use a Python interpreter or a mobile app that supports running Python scripts.
There are various apps available on app stores that allow you to run Python scripts on mobile devices.
